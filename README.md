# Learning-AND-Project-of-DL
# Deep Learning Project (Learning Phase)

I build this Deep Learning Project by following a YouTube Tutorial.
The main goal of this project is to **learn the basics of preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation** in Deep Learning.  
Since I am in the learning phase, there might be some mistakes, but this project reflects my current progress and understanding.

## Project Overview
- Built a simple Neural Network model for classification.
- Implemented the full ML workflow: **Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Model Evaluation**.
- Visualized model performance during training and validation.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **scikit-learn**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Applied `StandardScaler` for feature scaling/normalization.

2. **Model Training**
   - Created and compiled a Neural Network using:
     - Optimizer: `Adam`
     - Loss: `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`
   - Trained the model on the training dataset.
   - Plotted training and validation accuracy for better understanding.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated the model on the test dataset.
   - Printed accuracy results for performance measurement.
